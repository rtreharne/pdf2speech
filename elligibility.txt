The IAA Scheme is only open to academic colleagues who are or have been principle or Co -investigators (PIs/Co-Is) on EPSRC funded projects
The project must be on the Faculty Register of potential REF Impact Case Studies, or expect to generate a new case over the course of the award
The main aim must be to move academic research towards real-world application, e.g. funded activity should have realisable impact/tangible outcomes with key applications, i.e. design and manufacturing of commercial products and new high-technology businesses
The IAA does not fund research and expects research to be well established at the time of application. However, it is reasonable that the concept is at an early stage and not realistically able to attract investment finance for licensing or spin-out
Projects with limited potential for knowledge-exchange or impact or only likely to achieve primarily academic impact are unlikely to be successful
PDRAs are encouraged to act as co-I on IAA awards
Ensure you discuss the IP position with Business Gateway prior to submission of the application
